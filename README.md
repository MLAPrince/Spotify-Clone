# Spotify-Clone

Making my first project  i.e clone of Spotify web player  while learning web development
This is a web-based music player inspired by Spotify, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project lets you browse, sort, and play songs from a single local folder, with a modern UI and interactive playback controls.
I didn't made an exact one but used the interface from spotify and then added the music player inside it

## Features

- Browse songs from a single local folder (e.g., `MySongs`)
- Sort songs by title (ascending/descending)
- Play, pause, next, previous song controls
- Seekbar and progress bar for playback
- Volume control and mute/unmute
- Song duration display
- Highlight currently playing song
- Responsive and modern UI

## Folder Structure

```
├── index.html
├── script.js
├── style.css
├── utitlity.css
├── Images/
│   ├── *.svg, *.png, etc.
├── NCS/
│   ├── *.mp3
```

## How to Run

1. Start a local web server (e.g., using Python, Node.js, or VS Code Live Server) in the project directory.
2. Ensure your music files are placed in the `MySongs` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
- Local web server to serve files (required for folder scanning and audio playback)
